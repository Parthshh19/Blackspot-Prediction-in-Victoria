# Blackspot-Prediction-in-Victoria-

The project addresses the pressing issue of road accident blackspots through 
data-driven insights to develop effective interventions, campaigns, and reforms. 
Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, the initiative aims to enhance road safety by 
identifying risk factors and patterns associated with blackspots. The Business 
Analysis Core Concept Model guides the process, emphasizing the need for 
targeted measures, stakeholder involvement, and practical value. 

The stakeholders, the Victorian Department of Transport (DOT), the general 
public, and local authorities, are central to this endeavor. By leveraging a machine 
learning model, the analysis provides evidence-based decision-making for 
interventions, legislative changes, and tailored education campaigns. The 
outcomes have significant value, leading to safer roads and reduced accidents.

The dataset, derived from crash and demographic data, underwent rigorous 
cleansing and preprocessing. Visualizations highlighted key insights, such as the 
influence of factors like primary schools, traffic signals, and household car 
ownership on blackspot occurrences. A logistic regression model was employed 
due to its suitability for binary classification. 

The model's evaluation showcased its strengths, including high precision and 
recall for non-blackspots, as well as a reasonable accuracy and interpretability. 
However, challenges such as low recall for blackspots and class imbalance were 
identified. 

To address these challenges, recommendations include leveraging real-time 
monitoring, refining the model using more data, and fostering collaboration 
among stakeholders. The solutions encompass targeted interventions, tailored 
campaigns, and evidence-based legislative reforms. Additional data sources like 
weather and traffic flow can further enhance the model's accuracy. In conclusion, 
the project provides actionable insights to tackle road safety concerns and drive 
positive change.
